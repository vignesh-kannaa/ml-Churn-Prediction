<h1>Churn Prediction for Bank</h1>
    <div>
      The churn rate is a critical metric in the financial industry, measuring
      the rate customers discontinue their relationship with a company
      or service. Understanding and predicting churn is paramount for
      businesses as it directly impacts revenue and customer retention. In this
      project, we aim to explore and analyze financial data using machine
      learning models and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain
      insights into customer behaviour and factors influencing churn. By
      leveraging these techniques, we seek to develop effective strategies for
      reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction, ultimately driving
      business growth and success.
